# AI Integration Guide

This document outlines how AI is integrated into the Customer Success Hub to generate summaries, provide insights, and enhance the user experience.

## Overview

The Customer Success Hub uses OpenAI/Claude APIs to provide the following AI capabilities:

1. **Summary Generation**: Create comprehensive customer summaries from raw data
2. **Call/Meeting Analysis**: Extract key insights from call transcripts and meeting notes
3. **Section Correction**: Allow users to highlight specific sections and request improvements
4. **Contextual Suggestions**: Provide recommendations based on customer data patterns

## Implementation Details

### AI Service Architecture

The AI functionality is implemented through a service-based architecture:

```
src/
  services/
    ai/
      ai-service.ts         # Main AI service interface
      openai-service.ts     # OpenAI specific implementation
      claude-service.ts     # Claude specific implementation
      prompt-templates.ts   # Reusable prompt templates
      context-builders.ts   # Functions to build AI context
```

### Summary Generation Process

1. **Data Collection**: Gather all relevant customer data
2. **Context Building**: Format data into a structured context
3. **Prompt Generation**: Create a specific prompt based on the template
4. **API Request**: Send the request to OpenAI/Claude
5. **Response Processing**: Parse and structure the AI response
6. **Result Rendering**: Display the generated summary to the user

### Example Prompt Template

```typescript
export const CUSTOMER_SUMMARY_PROMPT = `
You are an expert Customer Success Manager tasked with creating a comprehensive customer summary.

Based on the following customer data, create a well-structured executive summary that highlights:
1. Current relationship status and health
2. Key value the customer is getting from our products
3. Active projects and their status
4. Risks and mitigation strategies
5. Recommended action items

Customer Data:
{{customerData}}

Recent Communications:
{{recentCommunications}}

Please format your response in clear sections and use professional business language.
`;
```

## User Experience

### Summary Generation UI

- Users can trigger summary generation from the customer detail page
- Progress indicators show when AI is processing
- Results are displayed with the option to edit or regenerate

### Section Correction Flow

1. User highlights a section of the summary
2. User provides additional context or correction instructions
3. System sends the original section, user feedback, and relevant data to the AI
4. AI generates an improved section
5. User can accept, reject, or further modify the suggestion

## Configuration

AI services can be configured through environment variables:

```
# .env file
AI_PROVIDER=openai      # or "claude"
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here
CLAUDE_API_KEY=your_key_here
AI_MODEL=gpt-4          # or "claude-3-opus", etc.
AI_TEMPERATURE=0.3      # 0.0-1.0 for randomness control
```

## Best Practices

### Prompt Engineering

- Be specific in prompt instructions
- Include examples where helpful
- Structure data consistently
- Use system and user roles appropriately

### Error Handling

- Implement retry logic for API failures
- Provide graceful fallbacks when AI services are unavailable
- Log and analyze errors to improve prompts

### Performance Optimization

- Cache results where appropriate
- Use streaming responses for long-form content
- Implement request throttling and batching

## Future Enhancements

1. **Predictive Insights**: Forecast customer health and renewal likelihood
2. **Automated Action Items**: Suggest actions based on customer patterns
3. **Multi-Modal Processing**: Analyze images, charts, and other non-text data
4. **Conversation Simulation**: Prepare for customer conversations with AI role-play

## Ethical Considerations

- Always maintain user oversight of AI-generated content
- Be transparent about which content is AI-generated
- Ensure privacy and security of customer data
- Monitor and prevent potential bias in summaries

## Prompt Lifecycle Management

Prompts will be versioned and managed similar to code:

1. Prompt templates are stored in version control
2. Changes go through review process
3. Performance metrics are tracked by prompt version
4. A/B testing can be implemented for prompt improvements
