# Project Plan

## Project Overview

Customer Success Hub is a web-based platform designed to replace a previous RTF-based customer summary system with an interactive, data-rich experience. The system will allow Customer Success Managers to create, manage, and visualize customer data, generate AI-powered summaries, and easily track customer health.

## Project Goals

1. Create a beautiful, interactive web interface for customer data
2. Implement flexible data storage with advanced filtering capabilities
3. Integrate AI for summary generation and insights
4. Provide visualization tools for individual customers and book of business
5. Support future integrations with various customer success tools
6. Build a maintainable, extensible codebase

## Project Scope

### In Scope

- Customer data management system
- Interactive summary pages
- Advanced filtering and search
- Data visualizations and dashboards
- AI summary generation and correction
- Export functionality
- Local file system storage
- Multi-user access (basic)

### Out of Scope (Initial Version)

- Real-time collaboration features
- Direct integrations with external systems
- Advanced user permissions system
- Mobile applications
- Enterprise-level scaling features

## Project Timeline

The project will be developed in phases over approximately 10-15 weeks. See [ROADMAP.md](./ROADMAP.md) for a detailed breakdown of phases and tasks.

### High-Level Timeline

- **Phase 1**: Foundation (2-3 weeks)
- **Phase 2**: Customer Dashboard (2 weeks)
- **Phase 3**: Customer Detail Pages (2-3 weeks)
- **Phase 4**: AI Integration (1-2 weeks)
- **Phase 5**: Advanced Features (2-3 weeks)
- **Phase 6**: Testing & Deployment (1-2 weeks)

## Technology Stack Selection

### Frontend

- **Framework**: React with TypeScript
  - Modern, widely-used framework with strong typing
  - Component-based architecture for reusability
  - Large ecosystem of libraries and tools

- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
  - Utility-first approach for rapid development
  - Highly customizable for beautiful UI
  - Responsive design support

- **State Management**: React Query + Context API
  - React Query for data fetching, caching, and synchronization
  - Context API for global state
  - Reduces boilerplate compared to Redux

### Backend/Data

- **Storage**: Local file system (JSON files + SQLite)
  - Structured JSON for customer data
  - SQLite for efficient querying
  - Simple backup and restore capabilities

- **APIs**: Express.js
  - Lightweight API server for data operations
  - Easy to deploy on DigitalOcean
  - Well-documented and widely used

### AI Integration

- **Services**: OpenAI API / Claude API
  - State-of-the-art language models
  - Well-documented APIs
  - Flexible prompt engineering capabilities

### Deployment

- **Hosting**: DigitalOcean
  - As specified in requirements
  - Simple Docker deployment
  - Reliable hosting with reasonable pricing

## Development Approach

### Version Control

- GitHub repository for all code
- Feature branch workflow
- Pull request reviews
- Semantic versioning

### Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for utilities and services
- Component tests for UI elements
- End-to-end tests for critical flows
- Manual testing for AI features

### Documentation

- Comprehensive README
- Code comments and documentation
- User guides
- API documentation

## Risk Management

### Identified Risks

1. **Scope Creep**: The project has many potential features and integrations.
   - *Mitigation*: Clearly define MVP features and prioritize ruthlessly.

2. **AI Reliability**: AI-generated summaries may not always meet quality expectations.
   - *Mitigation*: Implement review processes and correction capabilities.

3. **Data Volume**: Handling large amounts of customer data might impact performance.
   - *Mitigation*: Implement pagination, lazy loading, and optimization techniques.

4. **Technical Debt**: Rapid development might lead to maintenance challenges.
   - *Mitigation*: Regular code reviews, consistent architecture, and documentation.

## Success Criteria

1. System successfully stores and displays customer information
2. Users can easily filter and search across all data points
3. AI-generated summaries provide valuable insights
4. UI is intuitive and visually appealing
5. System can be extended with new features and integrations
6. Performance remains fast with 10-100 customers
7. Code is maintainable and well-documented

## Project Team

- **Product Owner**: James McArthur
- **Development**: AI assistance with human review and contribution
- **Testing**: Combined AI and human testing

## Next Steps

1. Review and finalize project plan
2. Set up development environment
3. Implement core data structure
4. Begin developing UI components
5. Regular check-ins to review progress and adjust course as needed
